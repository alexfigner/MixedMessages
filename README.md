Codecademy Mixed Messages Project - Quote Remix
## General Info
This projects aims to 'remix' famous movie quotes, replacing nouns and action verbs from the quote with replacements generated by the program. Verbs and nouns are imported at via the resources.txt file to make it easier to later add large quantities of new replacements. My project current features two quotes, but I plan to update it with more more interesting ones.

## Status
This project is stable and viable, but open to resource expansions.
